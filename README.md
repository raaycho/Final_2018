Description
The data visualization you see before you is information found on the New York Department of Health website. The information is all of children 0-19 years old and their cancer incidences in the 5 boroughs in New York City. The purpose of this visualizaiton is to make it known and make it more personal to the audience, where they live and how many children in their neighborhood might have cancer. To put them in the thought process of thinking about where they live and that it is very much real and even their neighbor.

Usage
The usage of this visualization is for people who want to take a closer look at how many children really have cancer in New York City. For the purpose of drawing attention to their neighborhood and for my thesis. To define the problem, this visualization is meant to help set the stage.

Procedure
Collecting
- I collected my data from the New York Department of Health website and looked for alternative ways to make the data more easily accessible and easier to read since it was all in chart form. To make it into a map where you can more easily access and view where and what areas might have the highest concentration of children diagnosed with cancer.

Visualizing
The visualization was done to make the data more personal. If you were to see on the map and look up where you live, for example, Bed-Stuy, then you could see exactly how many average childhood cancer incidents there are in your neighborhood, which makes the whole situation a bit more daunting and real to the viewer. My intention was not to scare the viewer but actually to make more known and obvious the data.


Analysis
When I was looking at the data, all I saw were numbers and really numbers are difficult to understand. People are visual learners so I was able to cleanup the data into a map so that you can directly go to your neighborhood or borough and see exactly how many cancer incidences there were in the past 5 years.
