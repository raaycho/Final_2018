# Final 2018 Childhood Cancer Rates 2011-2015 in NYC

# Description
The data visualization you see before you is information found on the New York Department of Health website. The information is all of children 0-19 years old and their cancer incidences in the 5 boroughs in New York City. The purpose of this visualizaiton is to make it known and make it more personal to the audience, where they live and how many children in their neighborhood might have cancer. To put them in the thought process of thinking about where they live and that it is very much real and even their neighbor.

# Usage
The usage of this visualization is for people who want to take a closer look at how many children really have cancer in New York City. For the purpose of drawing attention to their neighborhood and for my thesis. To define the problem, this visualization is meant to help set the stage.

# Collecting
- I collected my data from the New York Department of Health website and looked for alternative ways to make the data more easily accessible and easier to read since it was all in chart form. To make it into a map where you can more easily access and view where and what areas might have the highest concentration of children diagnosed with cancer.

# Visualizing
- The visualization was done to make the data more personal. If you were to see on the map and look up where you live, for example, Bed-Stuy, then you could see exactly how many average childhood cancer incidents there are in your neighborhood, which makes the whole situation a bit more daunting and real to the viewer. My intention was not to scare the viewer but actually to make more known and obvious the data. Once I had collected all the data, I first created a mockup of the interface that I intended to create. And using Adobe XD I created the working prototype of the visualization in website form. I had never used Adobe XD but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and was able to link every element on the page to an artboard which in turn was generated into working links and output onto an XD weblink.

The visualization had to be in interactive so that people could personally see and pinpoint where they live, by borough and see which neighborhoods had the highest amount of cancer rates in children and not. Originally, the visuals were very simple but as I designed on, I realized that maybe you wouldn't be able to get a full picture of what the cancer rates look like if it were just to show different boroughs, so I color coded the darkest color as the heaviest in incidences and the lightest colors with the least amount, but this isn't to say that there are very few incidences. It just helps to better locate and understand and relate to colors, and so I also added a graph next to the borough of click choice.

# Analysis
- When I was looking at the data, all I saw were numbers and really numbers are difficult to understand. People are visual learners so I was able to cleanup the data into a map so that you can directly go to your neighborhood or borough and see exactly how many cancer incidences there were in the past 5 years.

I learned so much from this final project. In learning about exactly what areas are in certain boroughs of NYC and how many children are diagnosed with cancer. I didn't actually look up my own neighborhood until I was done and I was happy to learn that Queens County is the lowest amount of children diagnosed with cancer.
